This app is meant to be used with the old BattleForge client for Skylords Reborn, the revived version of Electronic Arts' BattleForge

The point of the app is to simulate a borderless window simply by positioning the windowed version
in such a manner that the borders and the titlebar will be outside of the screen
so it will give the convenience of a borderless window but only showing the actual game area.

To use it, simply download the BFr.exe, start it and chose Look for BF -> Start looking.
In this case a progress bar will show that the app is active and waiting for you to start up the game.
Once it detects the BattleForge client, It minimises to the taskbar (on modern windowses you might have to allow it in the taskbar settings)
and keeps controlling the game, aka positioning the game to correctly be displayed and to keep the mouse cursor locked to the game window.

The taskbar icon shows with red if no BattleForge client is running, blue if its running but not active (eg alt+tabbed to an other window)
and green if the game is running and is the active window.

There is also an option in the menu to Loof for BF -> Start automatically, if you click this option, it gets checked, saves itself
into windows' autorun settings (in the registry, so depending on your windoes settings you might need to run the app as administrator to enable this functionality)
In this case the app starts every time with windows, and automatically miinimizes itself and starts looking for the game, so you dont have to
remember always starting it before the game. It uses very little resources, but if you are worried about it always running in the background,
you can just keep running it manually...

The app is completely free to everybody to use, modify or distribute as you please, I don't even care for credits,
it was made purely to help people enjoying the game even more.

Have Fun!
